# Nannou Experiments

A collection of Rust examples exploring the [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/) creative coding framework. The examples included are just PoCs to see what Nannou can do, and showcases techniques inspired by:

- [Daniel Shiffman’s _Nature of Code_](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/examples/nature_of_code)
- [Chris Biscardi’s Nannou videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisBiscardi)
- Personal experiments

## workspace

This repo is laid out using Rust workspaces. There is currently a single `examples` workspace.

## Usage

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. In the project root:

   ```bash
   
   cargo run --release --example <example_name>

Replace <example_name> with any of the script names in the examples workspace.

## Future Plans

Extend these examples to drive lasers and audio. Continue exploring more creative coding concepts in Nannou.
